# Mango

### Project Description

The ecommerce store that we will build is for a fictional brick and mortar
shop Mango in the city of Auroville. The shop sells fresh vegetables and
fruits to its customers directly sourced from nearby farms. Due to popular
demand to reduce the carbon footprint, Mango has decided to open an online
store for its customers. However, the management still wants to continue
operating the physical shop for customers who prefer to visit the shop in
person. Also the online store only accepts orders from residents of Auroville
and delivers to only locations inside Auroville.
